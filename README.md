# NFL Game Predictor

The goal of this project is to build a model where users can input a "Home Team" and "Away Team" to predict which team would win in a head-to-head matchup. The model will also predict the upcoming slate of games for the week. Accordingly, we will also fetch new data on a weekly basis while the model is live.  

Currently, I am in the process of scraping relevant data from www.pro-football-reference.com. 

The training dataset includes game data for each team from seasons 2021 to 1994. The test dataset will utilize the results from the current 2022 season.
